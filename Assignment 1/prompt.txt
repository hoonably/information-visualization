Basic Prompts

"Help me preprocess this Chocolate Sales Dataset from Kaggle. I need to:
1. Load the CSV data using d3.csv()
2. Parse dates and convert sales values to numbers
3. Group sales by product category and month
4. Calculate the total sales for each category"

"Design a D3.js visualization for chocolate sales data that:
1. Creates a stacked bar chart showing monthly sales
2. Uses different colors for each chocolate category
3. Includes a legend for product categories
4. Implements tooltip showing sales details on hover"

"Complete my D3.js visualization by adding:
1. Smooth transitions when filtering data
2. Responsive design to fit different screen sizes
3. A simple filter control to show/hide specific chocolate categories
4. Proper axes formatting with month names and sales values"


My Additional Prompts
"The default color palette only shows 8 colors. How can I add more diverse and consistent colors for each category?"

"The legend on the right side gets cut off on screens. How can I fix this?"

"How can I make the entire chart responsive so it scales down properly on smaller screens, like mobile devices?"

"When filtering categories, I want the transition to smoothly shift the bars up and down â€” not just fade in/out. How can I achieve that?"

"Can you explain where to insert the code and which part to replace, when you give code snippets?"

"Is my implementation complete? Does it meet all evaluation criteria?"
